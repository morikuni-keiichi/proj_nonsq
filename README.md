# MATLAB codes for a projection method for eigenvalue problems of linear nonsquare matrix pencils

by Keiichi Morikuni, Ph.D.

## Usage

To generate a tall test matrix pencil, execute the following:
```
>> scrpt4tall
```
or to generate a wide test matrix pencil, execute the following:
```
>> scrpt4wide
```

To run the main function, execute the following:
```
>> scrpt4driver
```
Then the elapsed CPU time, relative residual norm, and the relative error are output, as well as the plots of the exact eigenvalues and computed eigenvalues in the complex plane.
